# HackHomelessness
Project build for the Hackerearth's Hacking Homelessness Hackathon.

We believe that there is good in everyone. There are several corporates and people willing to do good in the world. We just need to provide them with a well planned and set way that can fully enhance and benefit the Homeless.

4-Walls-For-All could be that solution.

1. Clone the repository
